I have been Working as a Security Officer for quite a while now, but soon, I will start my career in IT, focusing on building a strong foundation in security, cloud computing, and automation to help organizations stay  resilient. I am passionate of creating clear security policies and documentation that make complex ideas more accessible. Over time, I aim to grow my leadership skills and strategic thinking to work towards my goal of becoming a Chief Information Officer.
